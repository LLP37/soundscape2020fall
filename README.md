# Project 1: Soundscape Narrative

My project is titled Virtually_Alone to signify a day in the life in the virtual environment and how alone we are. It's also a play on the phrase when people say "I am basically ....", but this time it is virtually. The Virtually_Alone.aup and the Virtually_Alone.mp3 are the final versions, the FallSoundscape2020.aup is the rought draft version (I made a new version due to some issues I was having). The "No Audio Parts" folder is where Screenshots and preview statements can be found.
