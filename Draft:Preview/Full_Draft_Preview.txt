I am writing this preview as I have finished the first full draft of my Soundscape Narrative. Overall, I am happy with the outcome I think that some parts such as the 
parts where I am outdoors running/walking turned out better than expected and I really liked the part where I had three layered tracks. I do think that I may have to cut down a little on the outdoors section as I may want to add more to the conversation portion towards the end as it wasn't as long as I envisioned it being and I think that made it a little less emotional than I first envisioned. I do think the background music helped add something to the emotion of that part though and that my friend Delaney did a good job
giving her small take on how tired she is of being isolated in our room. In addition, I think one part that I had a lot of trouble with was uploading to Github as I don't think I did it properly the first time which led to issues, but it appears to me that everything is working correctly now, so I feel like I at least learned a lot about pushing to Github through Github Desktop. One thing that I am still confused about is the Assests and Sources files, I have been looking over other classmates to format my own, but I feel without that I would be lost as I don't really understand what proper format should be and I get confused with what I should write for Fair Use cases. One example of that in my piece is when I record the Zoom meeting recording sounds, I was told that I could use those under "Fair Use", but I don't really understand how I am supposed to demonstrate that. Am I supposed to write that it is my recording, but I am operating under a "Fair Use" idea? I think more clarification with citations would be helpful.
