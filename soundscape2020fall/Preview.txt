For this first preview of my Soundscape project, I have included two sounds. Both of which serve as part of my "quarantine" morning routine. The first sound included is an alarm noise (not recorded by myself). The second noise I have added in thus far is a sound I did record of me opening and closing my drawers. This was supposed to signify when I get dressed for the day. Though, when I listened to the sound after recording it, I realized that recording is going to be much harder than I thought. You could really only hear the sound of the drawer closing, but could not hear me opening it at all. Therefore, when I added the clip in Audacity I realized that it would actually work a lot better as a “slap noise” of me snoozing the alarm clock. I thought this was pretty cool actually, as I it made me realize that sounds can be “turned into” something other than their original purpose (i.e. the drawer open/close sound doesn’t need to be used to signify a drawer opening/closing). These two sounds together serve as the opening for my Soundscape, but I definitely have a lot more sounds to add, I just wanted to make sure I saved myself enough time to make sure I understand how to push to Github. The next steps would be to gather more sounds to add into my Soundscape, so that I go through the rest of my day and start to add in sounds that convey the emotional/mental toll that being in a virtual environment has had on a lot of people. One thing I need to look into is whether I will be able to find a way to use sounds like “This meeting is being recorded” (Zoom) and if I will be able to have some sort of Netflix clip or Youtube clip to convey when I have a little bit of free time what I like to do in the virtual environment since we really can’t go anywhere.
